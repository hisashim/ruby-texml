This is a simple implementation of a translator from the TeXML XML dialect into TeX syntax.

This is based of Douglas Lovell's paper: "TeXML: Typesetting with TeX", Douglas Lovell, IBM Research in TUGboat, Volume 20 (1999), No. 3.

The code is old, and probably stale (it depends on an XML parsing library which is probably not available anymore), but I guess it is better here on GitHub than simply rotting on my hard drive.
